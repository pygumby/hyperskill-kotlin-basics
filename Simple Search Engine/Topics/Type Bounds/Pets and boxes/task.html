<h2>Pets and boxes</h2>
<html><body><p>There is a class called <code class="java">Box</code>, which can be defined as a container for storing different things. But as we all know, pets prefer using boxes for other purposes: playing, sleeping, hiding in them, etc.</p>
<p>Complete the <code class="java">Box</code> class so that it could be applied only to objects of subclasses of the <code class="java">Animal</code> class. Inside this class, just declare the <code class="java">add(object)</code> which accepts an object of <code class="java">Animal</code> or its subclass as an argument. Keep in mind that <code class="java">Box</code> can also be empty.</p></body></html><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
