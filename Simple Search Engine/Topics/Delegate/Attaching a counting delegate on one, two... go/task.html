<h2>Attaching a counting delegate on one, two... go!</h2>
<p>You are given an interface and its implementation, so your task is to complete the <code class="java">Iterator</code> class using the said implementation as a delegate to count the number of calls made to the function <code class="java">next()</code>, which you need to implement. For the sake of simplicity, assume that the function <code class="java">next()</code> does not do anything apart from calling a delegate.</p>
<p>In other words, make a function <code class="java">next()</code> that counts its calls via the <code class="java">Counter</code> class present as a delegate.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">0</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">5</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
